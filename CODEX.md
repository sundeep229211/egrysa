# Egrysa: canonical product truth

## Mission

Keep enterprise context, policy, memory, evaluations, and learning inside the customer boundary
while making frontier models replaceable compute suppliers.

## Product claim

Egrysa is a customer-owned AI egress control plane. It reduces disclosure through deterministic
blocking, minimization, request-scoped surrogates, local-only routing, and content-minimized,
cryptographically signed policy evidence.

It is not a VPN, an anonymity guarantee, a DLP replacement, a compliance certificate, or proof that
a model provider forgot data. Inference requests do not directly update model weights; provider
logging, retention, safety review, later training, and commercial learning are separate risks
governed by product behavior and contract.

## Current state

Built: OpenAI-compatible text ingress, SSE streaming for OpenAI-compatible providers, bounded
function-tool messages, model discovery, versioned local detector contract, deterministic
classification, policy routing, local recomposition, durable Ed25519-signed attributed receipts,
tests, synthetic evals, CI, and hardened deployment examples.

Not built: probabilistic NER, identity federation, tenant administration, multi-replica receipt
sequencing, HSM signing, multimodal inspection, autonomous tool execution, Anthropic streaming,
cross-provider decomposition, provider-control verification, hardware appliance, or third-party
certification.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never log or persist raw prompt, response, surrogate map, provider key, or client key.
2. Fail closed when a provider, model, data class, or API feature is not explicitly approved.
3. Never claim zero retention solely because `store=false` was sent.
4. Never claim certification. Say control-aligned or readiness evidence only.
5. Do not add a dependency where a reviewed platform primitive is sufficient.
6. Every new input modality, tool, streaming path, memory store, and provider is a new threat
   boundary requiring tests and documentation.
7. Preserve the OpenAI-compatible ingress unless a versioned breaking change is approved.

## Release gates

- Formatting, lint, type checking, tests, CodeQL, dependency review, and vulnerability audit pass.
- No high-severity exact secret leaves the policy layer in the evaluation corpus.
- Classifier and decision accuracy are at least 95% on the versioned evaluation set.
- No raw content appears in logs, metrics, errors, or receipts.
- Container runs as non-root with read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, seccomp, explicit
  egress, and no service-account token.
- SBOM and SLSA provenance accompany release artifacts.
- CISO-facing documentation matches demonstrated behavior.
