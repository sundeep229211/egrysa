## Capability-aware provider adaptation

    C -->|"unsupported semantic feature"| X["422 named capability"]
    C -->|"unsupported droppable tuning"| F["Remove field from cloned request"]
    C -->|"supported"| A["Provider adapter"]

    A -->|"Anthropic buffered response"| E["OpenAI SSE emulation"]
    E --> O
    F --> H["x-egrysa-downgraded"]
    E --> H
```

The default profiles live in `src/provider_capabilities.ts`; configuration can only narrow them.
Droppable tuning fields are removed before adapter serialization and named in a response header.
Tools, tool choice, streaming, stream options, temperature, and output bounds fail with 422 when the
selected profile cannot preserve their semantics. Anthropic streaming is intentionally buffered,
then emitted as stable OpenAI chunk frames and disclosed as `stream-emulated`.

## Data invariants

- Surrogate maps are request-scoped `Map` objects and are not passed to logging, receipt, or
  persistence code.
- Receipts contain workload attribution, a keyed nonce-bound request fingerprint, finding counts,
  decision, provider/model identifiers, and chain/signature values only. They contain no raw prompt
  or response content.
- Denials retain version-2/version-3 policy receipts. Provider attempts use version-4 receipts:
  non-streaming success records `egress:completed`, invocation failure records `egress:failed`, and
  native streaming records `egress:started` after upstream response headers arrive. Buffered stream
  emulation records `egress:completed` because upstream inference finishes before client egress.
  Native stream completion attestation is not claimed.
- When semantic detection is enabled, receipts add only detector IDs/versions and a degradation
  boolean. No receipt records finding text or request/response content.
- Provider credentials are read from named environment variables and never accepted in request
  bodies.
- Remote providers require HTTPS; plaintext HTTP is limited to loopback providers explicitly marked
  local.
- OpenAI-compatible upstream payloads use an allowlist of fields and force `store:false`.
- Native and emulated SSE content and tool-call argument fragments use bounded local recomposition.
  Anthropic emulation is not incremental; multimodal content still fails closed.
- Recomposition treats token-shaped, case-insensitive `EGRYSA_...` fragments as suspected damage
  even when a provider removes all leading underscores. This intentionally favors failing closed;
  ordinary prose such as “Egrysa is a gateway” lacks the separator/body shape and is not residue.
- Function definitions, message content, tool-call arguments, tool results, and JSON-schema string
  values are inspected. Sensitive structural schema keys cannot be transformed and are denied.
- Semantic detector inputs use only a configured loopback provider marked `local:true`; redirects
  are disabled, responses are bounded, model offsets are ignored, and candidates must occur
  literally in the inspected source. Deterministic findings win every overlap.
- Semantic findings are low precision. High-precision deterministic findings remain the only
  finding-based path to a hard deny; low-precision candidates transform or route locally.
- Receipt startup refuses a missing or empty active head when sequence-suffixed rotated logs exist,
  preventing an interrupted rotation from silently creating a duplicate sequence space.

## Known engineering limits

Deno/JavaScript strings are garbage-collected and cannot be deterministically zeroized. A
process-memory or host compromise can recover request content. Production should combine short
request lifetime, swap restrictions, encrypted nodes, process isolation, memory limits, crash-dump
controls, and an external security review. A future hardened data plane may use a memory-safe native
implementation with explicit secret-buffer handling, but that does not remove plaintext from active
process memory.

The reference semantic detector is probabilistic, model-dependent, and best-effort. It can miss
entities, hallucinate literal substrings, be evaded by obfuscation, or add seconds of latency. Its
failure policy is explicit: `degrade` discards semantic findings for the request and continues with
the deterministic floor, while `deny` stops the request for higher-assurance deployments.
