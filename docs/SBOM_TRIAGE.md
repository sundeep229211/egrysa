# Release-image SBOM advisory triage

Review date: 2026-07-15

## Scope and evidence

This review covers the image built by private release dry run
[`29397265834`](https://github.com/sundeep229211/egrysa/actions/runs/29397265834) from commit
`97838f95bf1578a6ea56c1f4de38f10c3eca2c0b`. The commits after that dry run change only tests and
documentation; the Containerfile, Deno configuration, source, and runtime configuration are
unchanged through commit `8528ee0008cb14e9f2917893daef4f4b886f6905`.

- CycloneDX document: 11 components, 14 unique advisories, and 17 affected-package occurrences.
- Retained artifact digest:
  `sha256:6f20f944340a6a5aa8764a1fddbec57a4b7299e5ff94d156529859886581c089`.
- Extracted SBOM digest: `sha256:1cc84bb53b686f7e1c953322acc929dc2690c0b90bd2008467acbda282511a15`.
- Trivy's Debian-vendor-prioritized result: four medium, ten low, and no selected high or critical
  advisories.
- The scan reported no fixed Debian Bookworm version for these package findings. Alternative scoring
  sources assign higher ratings to some entries, so selected severity alone is not the disposition.

## Alpha decision and recheck policy

The findings are accepted as monitored residual risk for a narrow, non-production public alpha. This
is not a claim that the packages are unaffected, that the advisories are fixed, or that the image
has no known vulnerabilities. The image still contains the packages Trivy identified.

Before a public tag:

1. rebuild from the protected release commit and regenerate the SBOM;
2. rerun the full vendor-prioritized scan and retain its machine-readable result;
3. adopt a patched Distroless/Debian base digest when one becomes available and passes regression
   testing; and
4. stop the release for any selected high or critical finding, any newly demonstrated remotely
   reachable path, or any material change in vendor disposition.
