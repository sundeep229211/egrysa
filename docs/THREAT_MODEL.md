# Threat model

## Assets

Prompt and response content; enterprise identifiers and strategy; credentials; provider and client
keys; policy configuration; surrogate maps; receipts; provider selection; availability.

## Trust boundaries

1. Client to Egrysa.
2. Egrysa process to configuration and secret injection.
3. Egrysa to the optional customer-hosted semantic detector.
4. Egrysa to local inference.
5. Customer egress to remote provider.
6. Build system to release artifact.

| Receipt tampering                       | durable chain, Ed25519 signatures, sequence, signed checkpoint                                   | software-held key can rewrite history not anchored outside the gateway            |

| Hallucinated semantic finding           | strict schema, exact source lookup, low precision, deterministic priority                        | a literal but non-sensitive substring can still be transformed or routed local    |

| Silent provider feature loss            | explicit capability table, validated narrowing overrides, 422 on semantic gaps, downgrade header | an incorrectly declared provider can still reject or misapply a supported field   |
| Buffered stream emulation               | bounded provider response, standard SSE frames, explicit `stream-emulated` downgrade             | no incremental delivery; upstream latency and cancellation differ from native SSE |
| Streaming residue outside mapped deltas | residue audit on delta content and tool arguments                                                | refusal and vendor-extension fields are not structurally audited in SSE           |

## Out of scope for v0.1

Compromised customer endpoints; malicious cluster administrators; nation-state traffic correlation;
side channels inside model-provider infrastructure; complete semantic anonymization; training-data
extraction from models; multimodal steganography; autonomous tool execution; durable organizational
memory; regulatory legal opinion.

## Security assumptions

- TLS terminates at a customer-controlled ingress or service mesh; the pod listens on HTTP inside
  the protected network.
- Secrets come from a managed secret store, not a manifest or `.env` file in production.
- The customer validates provider contracts, retention mode, residency, and feature eligibility.
- Local inference is actually inside the approved trust boundary.
- The confidential-term taxonomy and evaluation corpus are owned and reviewed by the customer.
- The semantic detector endpoint, model artifacts, runtime, and network path remain inside the
  customer-controlled trust boundary.
- The JSONL receipt backend is durable but single-writer. Horizontal scaling requires a sequencing
  backend, and truncation detection requires an operator or auditor to retain signed checkpoints
  outside the gateway. Rotated `receipts.jsonl.<sequence>` archives are not loaded at startup;
  externally retained checkpoints are the removal-detection anchor.
- Workload keys are the resource-exhaustion attribution boundary, not a rate limiter. Place the
  gateway behind a rate-limiting ingress for untrusted-adjacent workloads.
- Capability overrides can only narrow adapter defaults. They remain operator assertions rather than
  proof that a particular provider version honors a field correctly. Committed conformance reports
  are point-in-time evidence for the recorded provider, model, and date, not certification.
- Anthropic stream emulation waits for the complete bounded upstream response before emitting SSE.
  Clients must treat `x-egrysa-downgraded: stream-emulated` as non-incremental delivery and should
  size deadlines accordingly.

Semantic detection is best-effort and never the fail-closed floor. A semantic candidate cannot
hard-deny a request by itself. If the detector times out, disconnects, exceeds bounds, or violates
its response schema, all semantic findings for that request are discarded. The default `degrade`
mode continues with deterministic findings and records the degradation; high-assurance operators can
set `onDetectorFailure:"deny"` to stop traffic instead.
